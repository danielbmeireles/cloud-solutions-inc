## Architecture Attribution

The architecture implemented in this project is based on the AWS reference architecture diagram "Expose Microservices in a Hybrid Scenario Using Amazon EKS," available at https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/reference-architecture-diagrams/. The original design has been adapted and modified to meet the specific requirements of this implementation.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools:

- **Documentation**: The majority of the project documentation was generated using Claude (Anthropic)
- **Code Development**: GitHub Copilot was utilized in agent mode throughout the coding phase
- **Commit Messages**: Commit messages were crafted with the help of ChatGPT
- **Policy Review**: Security and access policies were reviewed and refined using AI assistance due to limited prior experience in this area

## Important Notes

The use of AI assistance did not reduced the necessity for a thorough understanding, coding proficiency and validation of the implemented solution.

Although AI tools have greatly accelerated development and enhanced code quality, all content generated has been written, reviewed, and tested by me.
