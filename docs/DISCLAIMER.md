## üìê Architecture Attribution

The architecture implemented in this project is based on the AWS reference architecture diagram "Expose Microservices in a Hybrid Scenario Using Amazon EKS," available at https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/reference-architecture-diagrams/. The original design has been adapted and modified to meet the specific requirements of this implementation.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools:

- **Documentation**: The majority of the project documentation was generated using Claude (Anthropic)
- **Code Development**: GitHub Copilot was utilized in agent mode throughout the coding phase
- **Commit Messages**: Commit messages were crafted with the help of ChatGPT
- **Policy Review**: Security and access policies were reviewed and refined using AI assistance due to limited prior experience in this area

## üìù Important Notes

The core of this project-its design, code, and validation‚Äîis a product of my direct effort and expertise. I leveraged AI as a powerful tool to enhance efficiency and explore optimizations, but its use did not diminish the necessity for a deep conceptual understanding and hands-on coding proficiency. Every aspect of the implementation was meticulously reviewed and tested by me, ensuring the final solution is both innovative and sound.
